# Mock Interview Q&A for Senior Front End Developer Role

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tell me about yourself and your experience related to this role.

**Answer:**

I have 12+ years of experience in frontend development, primarily working on enterprise-scale web applications. Over the last 6+ years, my focus has been on React.js, combined with TypeScript to build scalable, type-safe applications.

I‚Äôve led multiple projects where I was involved end-to-end ‚Äî from requirements gathering, UI/UX discussions, architecture design, API integration, to final deployment. I've worked on component-driven architectures, state management using Redux (with Redux Toolkit), React Query, and context APIs. Additionally, I have strong experience in optimizing performance, accessibility (WCAG compliance), and cross-browser compatibility.

Currently, I‚Äôm looking for a long-term opportunity where I can contribute my frontend leadership, mentor junior developers, and help architect robust, maintainable UI solutions.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why TypeScript with React? What are its advantages?

**Answer:**

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which is a huge advantage for large-scale React apps:

- Type safety reduces runtime bugs.
- Better developer experience: autocomplete, inline documentation, and IDE support.
- Refactoring becomes safer and faster.
- Improves documentation: interfaces and types define clear contracts between components.
- Team scalability: easier for multiple developers to collaborate with clear expectations on props, state, and function arguments.

In large projects, TypeScript dramatically improves maintainability and long-term stability.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ How do you manage state in your React applications?

**Answer:**

State management depends on the complexity of the application:

- For local component state: I use React‚Äôs built-in `useState` and `useReducer` hooks.
- For global state:
  - Redux (with Redux Toolkit for boilerplate reduction and better patterns)
  - Context API for lightweight shared state
  - React Query (for server state synchronization, caching, and optimistic updates)

I also ensure state slices are well-structured, normalized when necessary, and follow separation of concerns.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ How do you handle performance optimization in React apps?

**Answer:**

Several strategies:

- Code splitting using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`
- Memoization using `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Virtualization for large lists (e.g., `react-window`)
- Efficient state updates: avoid prop drilling and unnecessary global state.
- Optimize asset delivery (compression, CDN usage, lazy loading images/components)
- Monitoring performance via tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, Web Vitals, and APM dashboards if available.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ How do you ensure accessibility (a11y) and cross-browser compatibility?

**Answer:**

For accessibility:

- Follow WCAG 2.1 standards.
- Use semantic HTML elements.
- Manage ARIA attributes appropriately.
- Ensure keyboard navigation works.
- Use accessibility testing tools like Axe, Lighthouse, and manual testing with screen readers.

For cross-browser:

- Test on multiple browsers and devices early.
- Use CSS resets and polyfills when necessary.
- Stay updated on browser compatibility through resources like MDN.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Explain React Hooks vs Class Components. Why prefer Hooks?

**Answer:**

React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, etc.) allow functional components to manage state and side effects without needing class components.

**Advantages of Hooks:**

- Less boilerplate code.
- Easier code reusability via custom hooks.
- Better separation of concerns.
- Cleaner and more readable syntax.
- Encourages functional programming patterns.

Since React 16.8, Hooks are considered the modern, recommended approach, and I heavily use them in all my current projects.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Have you worked with component libraries or built design systems?

**Answer:**

Yes. I have experience with:

- Material UI, Ant Design, TailwindCSS, and Chakra UI for fast UI development.
- Built custom reusable component libraries internally for multiple clients.
- Followed atomic design principles to build scalable and consistent component libraries.

Building design systems involves close collaboration with UX teams, defining reusable tokens (colors, fonts, spacing), version control, documentation (Storybook), and continuous updates.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ How do you handle API integration and error handling?

**Answer:**

- Use Axios or Fetch API for HTTP requests.
- Abstract API calls into service layers.
- Use React Query or Redux middleware (e.g., Redux Toolkit Query) for efficient server state management.
- Implement centralized error handling using interceptors or global error boundaries.
- Show meaningful error messages to users and log technical errors for monitoring.

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ How do you review code and mentor junior developers?

**Answer:**

- Ensure code readability, consistency, and adherence to team standards.
- Encourage test coverage (unit and integration).
- Focus on simplicity, scalability, and reusability.
- Provide constructive, actionable feedback.
- Pair programming sessions and regular knowledge-sharing meetings.

Mentoring involves both technical and soft skills coaching to build confidence and ownership.

### üîü Why do you think you're a strong fit for this role?

**Answer:**

I bring deep technical expertise in React.js and TypeScript, strong experience in building scalable enterprise-grade applications, and a solid understanding of architectural best practices.

Additionally, I contribute leadership, mentorship, and collaboration skills, ensuring teams deliver high-quality, maintainable code. My past experience handling complex projects end-to-end aligns well with the expectations for a Senior Front End Developer in this role.
